	<h2>Origin</h2>
	<p>Tacos as we know them originated in Mexico, and they came to the United States via the large number of Mexicans who migrated during and in the years preceding the Mexican Revolution. Pollo Asado tacos are bursting with juicy, marinated chicken and bright citrus flavor. Each bite is nestled in warm tortillas and topped with fresh salsa, avocado, and a burst of zesty lime.</p>
	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Chicken breast</li>
		<li>Oil</li>
		<li>Lime juice</li>
		<li>Garlic powder</li>
		<li>Onion powder</li>
		<li>Cumin</li>
		<li>Salt and pepper</li>
		<li>Tortillas</li>
		<li>Salsa verde</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Instructions</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Poach chicken: In a saucepan, add chicken and enough water to cover by 1 inch. Add 2 pinches salt, onion, garlic, and cilantro. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook until opaque and cooked through, 20–30 minutes. Meanwhile, make Tinga Sauce.</li>
		<li>Tinga Sauce: In a Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat until smoking, 2 minutes. Add the onions (you should hear a sizzle when they hit the pan). Stir until lightly caramelized, 20 minutes. Meanwhile, place tomatoes, peeled garlic cloves, chipotle peppers, and chicken stock in a blender. Purée on medium speed until smooth, 30 seconds; then add tomato mixture to the onions. Stir and simmer, 5 minutes.</li>
		<li>Remove chicken from poaching liquid. When cool enough to handle, shred by hand and add to Tinga Sauce. Check for seasoning, and add salt to taste (Chef Cámara adds 2–3 teaspoons). Simmer, 5 more minutes.</li>
		<li>Assembly: Divide Chicken Tinga evenly among the tortillas. Garnish each with an avocado slice and a sprinkle of sea salt before serving.</li>
